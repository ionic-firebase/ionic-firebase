# Ionic and Firebase

Hi, I'm Steve and my passion is learning how to build apps using Ionic and Firebase.
The goal of this repository is to attempt to bring together all the latest versions of Ionic and Firebase, combined with research
from the Internet, and present it through a working example code.

On top of this, I have used some popular features such as NGX-DATATABLE and Swiper.

Within the code, I take advantage of Firebase's features such as Query and Indexes, to enable more complex search criteria.

I would like to acknowledge the following people for their code and support in helping me put this all together ...
